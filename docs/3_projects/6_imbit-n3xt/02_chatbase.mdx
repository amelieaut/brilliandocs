## Changing the E-Mail

In order to change the underlying E-Mail of the ChatBot Account, access "**Account Settings**" within the menu bar and enter the new E-Mail. To finish the change, click "**Update**".

## Settings

Within the "**Settings**" section, you can change General Settings such as the Team Name and URL and delete the Team, but also adjust the current plan and Billing settings.

Under "**Plans**" an upgrade is possible if more resources are required to enable the use of the chatbot (or to be able to create more chatbots) - Individual upgrades (available monthly) can also be found further down the page

Under "**Billing**" you can see the number of messages used by the chatbot. The payment settings can be adjusted further down the page.

For advanced chatbot customisations, the use of such API keys is also possible under "**API Keys**".

## Chatbots

When the "**Chatbots**" bar is selected, all chatbots, that are currently available, can be seen and worked on by selecting the respective one.

### Parameter Adjustments

If you want to customise the chatbot, you must first select the chatbot to be edited by going to the "**Settings**" and selecting the chatbot to be edited (here: IMMBIT N3XT). You can then use various menu options to analyse and optimise the chatbot and add new data sources.
